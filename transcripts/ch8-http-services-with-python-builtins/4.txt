00:01 So we've seen Python 2 and urllib2 in action. 
00:05 Let's look at the built-ins for Python 3. 
00:08 So here we can see that we've got basically 
00:12 the same code that we use for Python 2 
00:14 and I am going to just upgrade it to the Python 3 version. 
00:17 So the first error, well, let me just show you actually, first of all, 
00:21 that we are running the Python 3 virtual environment 
00:24 that we have been for most of this class. 
00:27 So the first thing to notice is urllib2 is no longer a thing. 
00:30 Now there is a couple of choices. We have the errors that you might encounter, 
00:34 we have the request, we have the URL parser, 
00:37 and we have the robot parser as well as responses. 
00:40 What we are going to work with is just urllib.request for now, 
00:44 alright, just like before, the first thing that we had to do was get the post. 
00:47 So let's come down here and you can see get_posts is not looking so hot right now, 
00:52 because there is no urllib2 but let's look inside urllib.request.  
00:55 There is a URL opener, it is similar, it's not the same, it's similar, 
01:00 it has more or less the same signature here, 
01:05 and we can open the URL. There we go. 
01:10 Okay, so we want to open it like this and from here on, 
01:14 it looks pretty much the same, so get_posts is not going to be that different. 
01:19 Let's go and do a list here and look, we still have our post and everything, great.
