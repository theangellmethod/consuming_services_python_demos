00:01 Doing a GET to get the post from the API was actually pretty straight forward, 
00:05 so let's see how this works for adding a post.
00:08 We're going to use a lot of the same structure that we had before, 
00:11 we are going to get the same user interaction, we are going to get the same data, 
00:15 this time we do need to explicitly set the content-type 
00:18 because it's not going to do that for us, 
00:21 so then we're going to come down here and we would like to do something like this, 
00:24 urllib2.urlopen() and we can pass in data, but we can't like pass our headers for example, 
00:31 so in order to do that, we have to create a request type object 
00:35 and I am going to call it req so you don't confuse it with the Requests, 
00:38 the other external package, so we'll create urllib2.request object, 
00:44 and in here we can pass the URL, the data, the headers and so on. 
00:49 So we'll say URL and we'll say data= and I am going to hold off for a second there 
00:53 we'll say headers=headers, so this is not going to JSONify this for us, 
00:57 so we have to say json.dumps of our post_data dictionary, like so. 
01:03 Okay, so then we're going to do that, we're going to post this down here, 
01:07 we'll do a few things down here, say we want to response.close
01:10 because remember we don't want to forget that, 
01:13 and down here we want to do response.close actually let's do it right here, 
01:16 we could do a try, finally, but we are just going to avoid that for a second, 
01:20 so this should have a p in it, excellent, okay, so this is going to work 
01:23 and it's going to do a POST request, how do I know, I am just opening it, 
01:27 well, check this out, down here, we can get the method, if it has data, 
01:33 it's a POST, if it doesn't have data, it's a GET. 
01:37 Okay, so the fact that we add this data means we're doing a POST request, 
01:41 we can't do a GET request with data, and we can do a POST request only with it. 
01:47 So we can't do a post request without data, I guess that doesn't make any sense, 
01:51 but it's pretty constraining, as we'll see here in just a moment. 
01:54 Okay, so we can't do the status code, afterwards,
01:57 this is more or less the same, we'll say response.getcode 
02:01 and we'll say read like so, 
02:04 okay so if it doesn't work we're going to get that, and remember, 
02:08 we have to close it straight away, and then here let's say, 
02:11 or we'll better do this before text=response.read and then here 
02:16 we can say json.loads from string the text and that will be our post 
02:22 and hopefully it worked. Let's go and run it. Let's do a list. 
02:27 Alright good, let's add a new post, this post comes from Python 2. 
02:32 Python 2, and the view count is going to be one, how's it going to work? 
02:37 Here we go. Boom, created. Alright, beautiful. Let's list it again. 
02:42 Alright, now this post comes from Python 2, okay so that worked,
02:47 let's just really quickly look at the two other options, UPDATE and DELETE. 
02:51 They are not going to go so well, well, UPDATE says in order to update a post 
02:56 we have to do a PUT to URL, well, with urllib2 we can only do a GET or a POST. 
03:01 So, okay, can't call that function, can you? DELETE similarly, 
03:05 we have to pass the DELETE verb, we can do a GET or a POST, 
03:08 it has data or doesn't have data, too bad, you won't be able to call that either. 
03:12 Well, there is some really strong reasons 
03:14 to work with Requests from Python 2, right there, huh?
