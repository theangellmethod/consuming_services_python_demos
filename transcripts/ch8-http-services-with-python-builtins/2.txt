00:01 Here we are back in PyCharm, and this is something like 
00:05 the blog explorer that we just wrote in Requests in Python 3.
00:09 Now, we are going to run this in Python 2 and we are going to use the built-ins. 
00:13 So we are going to need to import urllib, there is the two versions, 
00:17 this is absolutely Python 2, so I am going to go with this here, 
00:21 and notice we are even checking to make sure it's running on Python 2 
00:24 and if I go and run this, you'll see that I've created 
00:28 a separate virtual environment based on Python 2 that we can use here. 
00:33 Okay, so let's look through, the app is basically the same, 
00:36 of course we had to switch raw input for input and print no longer takes parenthesis,
00:40 but other than that, you'll find there is not a whole lot different.
00:43 I don't think there is anything different in this code. So we go down here, 
00:47 and what we are going to do is we are going do is we are going to write get_post again, 
00:51 so we are going to come down, and we are going to create a response 
00:54 just like we did with Requests. 
00:57 So we are going to come down here and do something a little less obvious 
01:01 but it's not too bad. So we'll say for this basic get case unauthenticated 
01:04 don't have to do too much, so urllib2, url open, and we are going to pass url, 
01:08 we could pass the data and things like that but we're not going to do that, 
01:11 we're just going to pass the URL because this is a GET request. 
01:14 Now it doesn't have a status code, this is more function driven, 
01:17 there is no properties or anything like that, but we can come over here, 
01:20 and call getcode() as a function. Okay and then again, if an error happens, 
01:24 we'll leave it like it is now, it's going to end up in a big bad crash, 
01:28 so we also don't get the text this way,
01:30 we say read it's kind of like a stream sort of thing, 
01:33 so if that works, we should be able to get the data. Now this didn't look too bad, right? 
01:37 So let's go ahead and try running this. 
01:40 That is running in Python 2 and let's go ahead and list - oh it has no attribute JSON. 
01:46 Let's jump a little bit ahead. So this is going to have to be POST data 
01:49 and we are going to need to do a little bit of work. 
01:52 There is no built-in JSON here so we need to go and use the JSON module 
01:56 which we have to import and then we have to have this say loads to parse a string, 
02:01 we've already talked about this in previous videos, 
02:04 and then we give it the response.read text and maybe it's even worth writing this 
02:07 as a separate variable so we can check it out if we need to. 
02:10 Okay, try again, let's go list boom, easy breezy back to good. 
02:14 Well, that seems pretty cool, maybe we can go and write the next one 
02:19 without too much trouble. Now one more thing that can be tricky 
02:22 about working with this library is it can keep these sockets open, 
02:26 so it's really important that we close 
02:29 even though it's not in the auto-completion here that we close the socket. 
02:33 Now wouldn't it be cool if this could be used in the context manager? 
02:38 Well, it will be, shortly. But only in Python 3.
